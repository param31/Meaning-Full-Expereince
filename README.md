# Meaning-Full-Expereince

New York City, a city that never sleeps. Indeed. Under the countless lights and among a bunch of rich people, I saw a beggar crying. I went to check on him, and that was the biggest reality check for me. He said, "I'm tired man!." People are afraid to give me money as they feel like I am not trying enough to get out of where I am now. But in reality, I go and ask for jobs every day until dark but look at me. I am not presentable. They ask me to leave my phone number, so they call me back if there's an opportunity, but I don't have a cell phone. He said he cries every day seeing people take the subway back to their homes because he doesn't have a home. At that moment, I was speechless and didn't know what to say or do. I always used to have a dream of helping people when I'll be rich, but at that moment, I realized that it matters the most to help when you don't have anything rather than when you have everything. I got a meal for the guy and promised to help him. I tried to reach out to my contacts and explain everything. Now dan (that guy) is working as a Janitor at Mcdonald's and goes home every night happy and satisfied.
